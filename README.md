# News Categorizer - NLP Neural Network
## Description
The News Categorizer - NLP Neural Network project involved constructing a neural network model to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, specifically categorizing news articles into predefined categories using text features including headlines and short summaries. The project aimed to automate the categorization process, enabling efficient sorting and organization of news content based on relevant topics and themes.

## Skills/Tools Used
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Neural Network Architecture Design
- NLP Techniques
- Text Feature Extraction
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Results
- Implemented a neural network model capable of categorizing news articles based on text features.
- Achieved high accuracy in categorization tasks through model training and evaluation.

## Future Improvements
- Explore advanced NLP techniques for improved categorization accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features or data sources to enhance model performance.
